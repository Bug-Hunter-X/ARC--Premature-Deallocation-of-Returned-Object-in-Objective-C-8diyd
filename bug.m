In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object ownership and memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Consider the scenario where you have a method that returns an object. If you don't retain the returned object and the method's scope ends, the object might be deallocated prematurely, leading to unexpected crashes or data corruption. This is especially problematic if other parts of your code still hold references to that object.
