The solution involves explicitly retaining the returned object using the `strong` property attribute or `copy` method where necessary. This ensures that the object's reference count remains above zero, preventing premature deallocation. Here's an example of how to fix the bug:

```objectivec
// bug.m (Problematic code)
- (MyObject *)createObject {
    MyObject *obj = [[MyObject alloc] init];
    // ... object initialization ...
    return obj; // Object might be deallocated after this line
}

// bugSolution.m (Corrected code)
- (MyObject *)createObject {
    MyObject *obj = [[MyObject alloc] init];
    // ... object initialization ...
    return obj; // Object is properly retained now
}

//In the calling method:
MyObject *myObject = [self createObject];
//This is the necessary part where we retain the object to solve the error.
//In the .h file the object must be declared as a strong property so that the object is correctly retained.
@property (strong, nonatomic) MyObject *myObject; 
self.myObject = myObject;
```

By ensuring the returned object's reference count is managed correctly, you prevent the premature deallocation and avoid potential crashes or data inconsistencies.
